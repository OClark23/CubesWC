# Senior-Dev
Warren Clark

This is a capstone project for the CUBE initiative at BSU This project will involve the development of an interactive user interface (UI) and a server to store data. The UI will allow users to interact with the application, inputting their desired information and receiving feedback from it in real time. On the other hand, the server will be responsible for sending out this data as well as saving it securely for future use. This combination of technologies is essential for creating an effective system that can handle large amounts of data efficiently while providing a pleasant user experience at all times.
